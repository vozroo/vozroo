Hello,
🤗 I am Emin YAŞMIN.
💫 I have been developing myself in the field of software languages 
🕦 for 3 months. I am open to learning any kind of information. 
💻 After learning intermediate level c#, I realized that I was more successful in the web field,
📓 so I concentrated on HTML, CSS, JavaScript Languages. 
🎯 My goal = to be a Senior programmer in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL languages.
